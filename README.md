## Hey there! :smile: 
#### That's my studies of React that I've tried to fetch some datas of open API and rendering it in table and select.

## :computer: Requirements:
- NPM Version: 5.6.0
- Node Version: 10.0.0

## :keyboard: Installing:
- I. Clone this repository in Master branch;
- II. Make sure to have NPM v.5.6.0+ and Node v.10.0.0+ already installed;
- III. Inside this folder cloned, open your terminal/cmd/VSCode and type "npm install" to npm prepare the libraries and dependencies;
- IV. Now just type "npm start" and have fun \o/;
## :arrow_forward: Playing:
- I. Click on "Buscar dre" to activate select filter;
- II. Select one of options in Select;
- III. Click on "Gerar Tabela" to make a filtered table by your click choice;
- IV. If you wanna use "Tabela" just click on "Buscar" at first cointaner named "tabela" to show all Tables;
- V. You can type any DRE to filter though, but you just can see that in Console when you Select any Options;
- VI. Thats all, special thanks for LoneWolf Corp. Developers üçª :smile:
